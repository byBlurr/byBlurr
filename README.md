### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a 22 year old software engineer who has a strong interest in learning how and why things work the way they do. I would often disassemble and reassemble real life objects to learn more about them and answer any questions I have. I come from a motorcycle background and have always enjoyed learning the science behind the bikes and the riding itself, such as using the gyroscopic effect to pick up the bike out of corners.

#### Experience and Study ðŸŒ±
I first started learning to program from the age of 12, learning bits and pieces mostly from youtube and other programmers. For many years I learnt java on and off but eventually expanded my knowledge to other languages such as C# and a little C++. At this point I started to work on small projects and spend more time on learning. I then dabbled in other languages such as Python, Kotlin and Scala. From 2014 to 2017 I studied motorcycle mechanics at college as well as programming in my spare time. Since early 2018, I have put many hours into writing GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2 mods with mostly lua, C# and JSON. Doing so I learnt a lot about the process of developing, testing and releasing my work to a userbase of thousands, working with the userbase for feedback, ideas and testing. In 2019 I started university, studying BSc Computing & IT, along the software engineering path. Besides the history and general use of computers, I have studied modules that include robotics & AI, Object-Orientated programming and web development with JS, PHP, HTML and CSS. My most recent experience outside university has been C# and MySQL, where I have been furthering my knowledge and putting my university study into practice.

#### Current Work ðŸ”­ 
My current work includes working on small projects in my spare time. I have been mostly working on libraries and Discord bots in C# and .NET. I have been working along side Dragon Fruit Network (https://dragonfruit.network/) on Dragon6 (programming) and Link (testing and helping). I have also been working on a public Discord bot Lori's Angel, which I am currently in the process of rewriting from scratch for version 2.

    <ul>
      <li>bBotLibrary - A .Net library for creating Discord bots in seconds using Discord.Net. Originally put together to speed up the process of bot creation for myself but now shared through NuGet as Discord.Net.Bot.</li>
      <li>Lori's Angel - A Discord bot that was developed along side bBotLibrary as an example project but later became a project of its own.</li>
      <li>Global Bot - A Discord bot that added global text channels to guilds to allow guild to guild messages. This bot was written within a few days for the Discord Hackweek.</li>
      <li>Other APIs and libraries</li>
