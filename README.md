### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a software engineer that enjoys learning how things are made and why they work the way they do. I have a motorvehicle background and enjoy mechanical engineering as well as software engineering. I like to study software and mechanical things and will often read source code or disassemble objects to answer the questions I have.

#### Study ðŸŒ±
I am currently studying BSc Computing & IT (Software) to further my knowledge. I started learning Java when I was roughly 12 years old, I have since learnt/used many different languages including C++, C#, Python and Lua. I decided to start studying at university to fill the blanks as I was self taught and to iron out the bad habits in order to increase my confidence in working with a team.

#### Current Work ðŸ”­ 
I am currently contributing towards other projects, mostly with Dragon Fruit Network. I will often contribute towards libraries that I am actively using. I occasionally have smaller projects of my own that I work on, however currently I am using the majority of that time for studying.
